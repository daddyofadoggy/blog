{"title":"Introduction","markdown":{"headingText":"Introduction","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"This study presents a comprehensive analysis of distributed training strategies for large language models using PyTorch. Three distributed training approaches—**Data Parallel (DDP)**, **Fully Sharded Data Parallel with full parameter sharding (FSDP-Full/ZeRO-3)**, and **FSDP with gradient sharding only (FSDP-Grad/ZeRO-2)**—were implemented and evaluated against a single-GPU baseline. Experiments conducted on a **2x H100 SXM5** Lambda instance training **GPT-2 Large (774M parameters)** reveal that FSDP-Grad achieves **97.71% compute efficiency**, nearly matching single-GPU performance while providing memory savings and enabling larger-scale training.\n\nTraining large language models has become increasingly challenging as model sizes grow from millions to billions of parameters. A GPT-2 Large model with 774M parameters requires approximately **12GB of GPU memory** for training on a single GPU. This memory consumption breaks down as follows: **model parameters** stored in FP32 format consume ~3GB (774M × 4 bytes), **gradients** of the same size add another ~3GB, **optimizer states** (momentum and variance for AdamW) require ~6GB (2× parameters in FP32), totaling ~12GB for the model states alone. Additionally, **activation tensors** saved during the forward pass for backpropagation require extra memory that scales with batch size and sequence length. As models scale to billions or trillions of parameters, this linear memory growth makes single-GPU training infeasible, necessitating distributed training strategies.\n\nThis comprehensive study aims to: (1) **Implement and compare** three distributed training strategies: DDP, FSDP-Full (ZeRO-3), and FSDP-Grad (ZeRO-2); (2) **Analyze memory consumption**, throughput, and communication patterns for each approach; (3) **Profile GPU utilization**, compute vs. communication time, and operator-level performance; and (4) **Provide practical recommendations** for choosing the optimal strategy based on model size and hardware constraints.\n\nThe experimental setup utilized a **GPU 2x H100 SXM5 Lambda** instance with 2x NVIDIA H100 GPUs (80GB HBM3 each) connected via NVLink/NVSwitch for high-bandwidth GPU-to-GPU communication. The model configuration consisted of GPT-2 Large architecture with 774,439,808 parameters, sequence length of 1024 tokens, global batch size of 32, micro batch size of 8 per GPU, 20 training steps, and learning rate of 3e-4 with cosine annealing. The software stack included PyTorch 2.x with CUDA support, `uv` for Python package management, NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library) as the distributed backend, and PyTorch Profiler with Chrome trace export for profiling.\n\n---\n\n# Challenges in Distributed Training vs. Single GPU Training\n\n## Memory Constraints\n\n### Single GPU Training\n\nTraining a neural network on a single GPU requires storing:\n\n1. **Model Parameters (W)**: Original weights\n2. **Gradients (∇W)**: Same size as parameters\n3. **Optimizer States (O)**: For Adam/AdamW, stores first and second moments (2x parameter size)\n4. **Activations (A)**: Intermediate outputs saved for backward pass\n\nFor GPT-2 Small (**124,439,808 parameters**, or ~124M) with mixed precision training:\n\n```python\nParameters:       474.70 MB  (124M × 4 bytes in FP32)\nGradients:        474.70 MB  (same size as parameters)\nOptimizer States: 949.40 MB  (FP32: momentum + variance = 2× parameters)\nTotal Estimated:  1,898.80 MB\nActual Peak:      3,076.27 MB (includes activations and overhead)\n```\n\nThe parameter memory calculation: 124,439,808 parameters × 4 bytes (FP32) = 497,759,232 bytes ≈ 474.70 MB. Despite using mixed precision (FP16 for forward/backward passes), the optimizer maintains an FP32 master copy of weights, so the base parameter storage is FP32.\n\nThe **1,177.47 MB difference** between estimated and actual memory comes from:\n\n- **Activation tensors** stored during forward pass (~800-900 MB)\n- **Temporary buffers** for operations\n- **PyTorch framework overhead**\n- **Memory fragmentation**\n\n### Distributed Training Challenges\n\nWhen scaling to multiple GPUs, new challenges emerge:\n\n**1. Data Parallelism Memory Replication**\nTraditional DDP replicates the entire model on each GPU, which doesn't reduce per-GPU memory usage—it only enables larger batch sizes.\n\n**2. Communication Overhead**\nDistributed training introduces collective communication operations:\n- **All-Reduce**: Synchronize gradients across all GPUs (DDP)\n- **All-Gather**: Collect sharded parameters/gradients from all GPUs (FSDP)\n- **Reduce-Scatter**: Reduce and distribute results across GPUs (FSDP)\n\n**3. Synchronization Barriers**\nGPUs must wait for each other at communication points, potentially causing idle time if workloads are imbalanced.\n\n**4. Network Bandwidth**\nThe **data transfer rate** between GPUs, measured in GB/s (gigabytes per second). Higher bandwidth enables faster gradient/parameter synchronization. H100s use NVLink (900 GB/s bidirectional), allowing near-simultaneous compute and communication. Lower bandwidth (e.g., PCIe: 32 GB/s) creates bottlenecks where GPUs wait idle during all-reduce/all-gather operations.\n\n**5. Load Balancing**\nUneven data distribution or computational load can cause some GPUs to finish early and wait idle.\n\n## Communication vs. Computation Trade-off\n\nThe fundamental challenge in distributed training is **hiding communication latency behind computation**. Ideal distributed training achieves:\n\n```\nCompute Efficiency = (Compute Time) / (Total Time) × 100%\n```\n\nWhere `Total Time = Compute Time + Communication Time + Idle Time`.\n\n**Single GPU Baseline:**\n- Compute: 97.87%\n- Communication: 1.16% (memory transfers, kernel overhead)\n- Idle: 0.97%\n\n**Distributed Training Goal:**\nMatch or approach baseline efficiency while enabling:\n- Training models that don't fit on a single GPU\n- Faster training through data parallelism\n- Flexibility to scale to larger clusters\n\n## Gradient Accumulation and Synchronization\n\n### Single GPU Approach\n\nGradient accumulation simply accumulates gradients over multiple micro-batches before updating weights:\n\n```python\nfor micro_batch in range(grad_accumulation_steps):\n    loss = forward_backward(micro_batch)\n    loss.backward()  # Accumulate gradients\noptimizer.step()  # Update weights\noptimizer.zero_grad()\n```\n\n### Distributed Training Synchronization\n\nMust decide when to synchronize gradients:\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## The Synchronization Problem\n- Synchronizing every micro-batch **wastes bandwidth**\n- Using `no_sync()` context manager **prevents unnecessary all-reduce operations**\n- Only synchronize on the **last micro-batch** of gradient accumulation\n:::\n\nHere's the optimized approach:\n\n```python\nfor i, micro_batch in enumerate(batches):\n    is_last = (i + 1) % grad_accumulation_steps == 0\n\n    if not is_last:\n        with model.no_sync():  # Skip gradient synchronization\n            loss.backward()\n    else:\n        loss.backward()  # Synchronize gradients across GPUs\n```\n\nThis optimization reduces communication overhead significantly. The experimental results show that DDP with proper gradient accumulation achieves **97.36% compute efficiency**.\n\n## Memory Sharding Strategies\n\nTo overcome memory limitations, **Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP)** implements the ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer) approach:\n\n| Component | DDP (No Sharding) | FSDP-Grad (ZeRO-2) | FSDP-Full (ZeRO-3) |\n|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Parameters | Replicated | Replicated | Sharded |\n| Gradients | Synchronized | Sharded | Sharded |\n| Optimizer States | Replicated | Sharded | Sharded |\n| **Memory per GPU** | 100% | ~67% | ~33% |\n| **Communication** | All-Reduce | All-Gather (grads) | All-Gather (params) + Reduce-Scatter (grads) |\n\n<div align=\"center\"><em>Table 1: Comparison of Memory Sharding Strategies for Distributed Training</em></div>\n\nFor GPT-2 Large on 2 GPUs:\n- **DDP**: 12GB per GPU (no savings)\n- **FSDP-Grad**: ~8GB per GPU (1.5x reduction)\n- **FSDP-Full**: ~4GB per GPU (3x reduction)\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## The Trade-off\nMore aggressive sharding reduces memory but increases communication frequency and complexity.\n:::\n\n---\n\n# Distributed Training Approaches\n\n## Baseline: Single GPU Training\n\nThe baseline implementation serves as the reference point for performance comparison.\n\n**Implementation** (`train_baseline.py`):\n\n```python\n# Device setup\ndevice = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\n\n# Model initialization\nconfig = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(\"gpt2-large\")\nmodel = MyGPT2LMHeadModel(config)\nmodel.init_weights()\nmodel = model.to(device)\n\n# Gradient accumulation to match distributed global batch size\nglobal_batch_size = 32\nmicro_batch_size = 8\ngrad_acc_steps = global_batch_size // micro_batch_size  # 4 steps\n\n# Training loop with gradient accumulation\nfor batch in dataloader:\n    loss = model(batch)\n    scaled_loss = loss / grad_acc_steps\n    scaled_loss.backward()\n\n    if (step + 1) % grad_acc_steps == 0:\n        optimizer.step()\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\n```\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n\n- Simple, straightforward implementation\n- No communication overhead\n- Limited by single GPU memory capacity\n- Serves as performance upper bound (97.87% compute efficiency)\n\n**Performance Metrics:**\n\n```python\nTraining Time: 112.3s for 20 steps\nPeak Memory: 3,076 MB\nCompute Efficiency: 97.87%\nThroughput: 32,582 tokens/sec (batch size 8)\n```\n\n## Data Parallel (DDP)\n\n### Concept\n\nDDP replicates the model on each GPU and synchronizes gradients after the backward pass using an all-reduce collective operation.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n1. Each GPU maintains a complete copy of the model\n2. Each GPU processes a different subset of the data (data parallelism)\n3. After backward pass, gradients are averaged across all GPUs using all-reduce\n4. All GPUs update their models identically using synchronized gradients\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\nimport torch.distributed as dist\nfrom torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP\n\n# Initialize distributed process group\ndist.init_process_group(backend='nccl')\nrank = dist.get_rank()\nworld_size = dist.get_world_size()\nlocal_rank = int(os.environ['LOCAL_RANK'])\n\n# Set device for this process\ntorch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)\ndevice = f'cuda:{local_rank}'\n\n# Critical: All ranks must use same seed for identical initialization\ntorch.manual_seed(42)\ntorch.cuda.manual_seed(42)\n\n# Create model and wrap with DDP\nmodel = MyGPT2LMHeadModel(config)\nmodel.init_weights()\nmodel = model.to(device)\nmodel = DDP(model, device_ids=[local_rank])\n```\n\n### Key Implementation Detail: Gradient Synchronization with `no_sync()`\n\nFrom `distributed_trainer.py`:\n\n```python\ndef training_step(self, inputs, targets, should_sync: bool):\n    \"\"\"\n    Training step with DDP no_sync support.\n\n    Key concept: For gradient accumulation, we only sync gradients\n    on the last micro-batch to avoid unnecessary communication overhead.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Forward pass\n    logits = self.model(inputs)\n    loss = nn.functional.cross_entropy(\n        logits.view(-1, logits.size(-1)),\n        targets.view(-1)\n    )\n\n    # Backward with conditional synchronization\n    scaled_loss = loss / self.grad_accumulation_steps\n\n    if self.ddp_enabled and not should_sync:\n        # Don't sync gradients for intermediate micro-batches\n        with self.model.no_sync():\n            scaled_loss.backward()\n    else:\n        # Sync gradients on last micro-batch (triggers all-reduce)\n        scaled_loss.backward()\n\n    return loss\n```\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Why `no_sync()` Matters\nWithout this optimization, DDP would perform all-reduce after every `backward()` call:\n\n- With 4 micro-batches per step: **4 × all-reduce operations**\n- With `no_sync()`: **Only 1 all-reduce operation** (on the last micro-batch)\n- Result: **4x reduction in communication overhead**\n:::\n\n### Communication Pattern\n\n- **Operation**: All-Reduce (averages gradients across all ranks)\n- **Frequency**: Once per gradient accumulation cycle (every 2 micro-batches with 2 GPUs)\n- **Data Volume**: All gradient tensors (~475 MB)\n- **NCCL Implementation**: Ring all-reduce algorithm\n\n### Performance Metrics\n\n```python\nTraining Time: 58.3s (1.93x speedup over baseline)\nCommunication Overhead: 105.3 ms\nCompute Efficiency: 97.36%\nCommunication Overlap: 92.50%\n```\n\n### Advantages & Limitations\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n✅ Simple to implement (single `DDP()` wrapper)\n\n✅ Excellent performance when model fits in memory\n\n✅ Minimal code changes from single-GPU training\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n❌ No memory savings (full model replication)\n\n❌ Highest communication overhead among strategies tested\n\n❌ Doesn't scale to models larger than single GPU capacity\n\n## Fully Sharded Data Parallel - Full Sharding (FSDP-Full / ZeRO-3)\n\n### Concept\n\nFSDP-Full implements ZeRO Stage 3, sharding parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across all GPUs. Each GPU only stores a fraction of the model, reconstructing full parameters on-demand during forward/backward passes.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n1. Model parameters are sharded across GPUs (each GPU holds 1/N of weights)\n2. Before each layer's forward pass: **all-gather** to reconstruct full parameters\n3. After forward pass: parameters are freed, only shards retained\n4. Before backward pass: **all-gather** parameters again\n5. After backward pass: **reduce-scatter** to shard gradients across GPUs\n6. Optimizer updates only local parameter shards\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\nfrom torch.distributed.fsdp import FullyShardedDataParallel as FSDP\nfrom torch.distributed.fsdp import ShardingStrategy\n\ndef setup_fsdp_model(model, device, sharding_strategy_name='FULL_SHARD'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Wrap model with FSDP using per-layer wrapping.\n\n    Sharding strategies:\n    - FULL_SHARD: Parameters, gradients, optimizer states all sharded\n      -> Max memory savings, more communication\n    - SHARD_GRAD_OP: Only gradients and optimizer states sharded\n      -> Moderate savings, less communication\n    \"\"\"\n    model = model.to(device)\n\n    strategy_map = {\n        'FULL_SHARD': ShardingStrategy.FULL_SHARD,\n        'SHARD_GRAD_OP': ShardingStrategy.SHARD_GRAD_OP,\n        'NO_SHARD': ShardingStrategy.NO_SHARD\n    }\n    sharding_strategy = strategy_map[sharding_strategy_name]\n\n    # Per-layer wrapping for fine-grained control\n    # Each transformer block is wrapped individually\n    for i, block in enumerate(model.transformer.h):\n        model.transformer.h[i] = FSDP(\n            block,\n            sharding_strategy=sharding_strategy\n        )\n\n    # Wrap entire model\n    model = FSDP(model, sharding_strategy=sharding_strategy)\n\n    return model\n```\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Per-Layer Wrapping is Critical\nPer-layer wrapping enables:\n\n1. **Granular Memory Management**: Each transformer block can independently gather/shard parameters\n2. **Better Overlap**: While layer N is computing, layer N+1 can prefetch parameters\n3. **Reduced Peak Memory**: Only one layer's full parameters need to be materialized at a time\n4. **Communication Efficiency**: Smaller, more frequent all-gathers overlap better with computation\n:::\n\n### Communication Pattern\n\nFor a 36-layer GPT-2 Large model:\n\n- **All-Gather Operations**: ~73 calls (forward + backward for each layer)\n\n  - Each call gathers 1/N parameters from all GPUs\n  - Total duration: 50,074 μs (50.1 ms)\n  - Average per call: ~686 μs\n- **Reduce-Scatter Operations**: Shard and reduce gradients\n\n### Memory Breakdown (per GPU, 2 GPUs total)\n\n```python\nParameters:  6 GB / 2 = 3 GB per GPU (sharded)\nGradients:   6 GB / 2 = 3 GB per GPU (sharded)\nOptimizer:   2 GB / 2 = 1 GB per GPU (sharded)\nActivations: ~1.5 GB per GPU (not sharded)\nPeak Memory: ~4 GB per GPU (3x reduction vs. baseline)\n```\n\n### Performance Metrics\n\n```python\nTraining Time: 58.8s (1.91x speedup)\nCommunication Overhead: 94.7 ms\nCompute Efficiency: 96.98%\nCommunication Overlap: 95.14%\nIdle Time: 117.2 ms (highest due to frequent synchronization)\n```\n\n### Advantages & Trade-offs\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n✅ Maximum memory savings (3x with 2 GPUs, scales to 8x+ with more GPUs)\n\n✅ Enables training models that don't fit on a single GPU\n\n✅ Lower communication overhead than DDP despite more operations\n\n**Trade-offs:**\n\n⚠️ More complex implementation\n\n⚠️ Higher idle time (117ms) from 73 synchronization points\n\n⚠️ Parameter gathering overhead during forward/backward passes\n\n## Fully Sharded Data Parallel - Gradient Sharding (FSDP-Grad / ZeRO-2)\n\n### Concept\n\nFSDP-Grad implements ZeRO Stage 2, sharding only gradients and optimizer states while keeping parameters replicated. This represents the **sweet spot** between memory savings and performance.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n1. Full model parameters are replicated on each GPU (like DDP)\n\n2. Gradients are sharded across GPUs during backward pass\n\n3. Optimizer states are sharded (each GPU only stores 1/N of Adam moments)\n\n4. After backward: **all-gather** to collect full gradients for optimizer step\n\n5. Each GPU updates only its shard of optimizer states\n\n### Implementation\n\nThe implementation is identical to FSDP-Full, but uses a different sharding strategy:\n\n```python\n# Same setup_fsdp_model function, different strategy\nmodel = setup_fsdp_model(model, device, sharding_strategy_name='SHARD_GRAD_OP')\n\n# ShardingStrategy.SHARD_GRAD_OP tells FSDP to:\n# - Keep parameters replicated (no all-gather for params)\n# - Shard gradients (reduce-scatter after backward)\n# - Shard optimizer states (memory savings)\n```\n\n### Why FSDP-Grad Excels\n\n1. **No Parameter Gathering Overhead**: Parameters always available for forward/backward\n2. **Fewer Synchronization Points**: Only 37 all-gather calls (vs. 73 for FSDP-Full)\n3. **Consolidated Communication**: Gradient gathering happens during optimizer step (natural idle time)\n4. **Better Overlap Opportunity**: Fewer synchronization points = fewer pipeline bubbles\n\n### Communication Pattern\n\n- **All-Gather Operations**: 37 calls (gathering gradients + optimizer states)\n  - Total duration: 106,828 μs (106.8 ms)\n  - Average per call: ~2,887 μs\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## The Paradox\nFSDP-Grad has **higher total communication time** (106.8ms) than FSDP-Full (50.1ms), but achieves **better performance** due to 98.06% overlap vs. 95.14%!\n\n**Why?**\n```\nExposed Communication = Total Communication × (1 - Overlap %)\n\nFSDP-Grad: 106.8ms × 1.94% = ~2ms exposed communication\nFSDP-Full: 50.1ms × 4.86% = ~2.5ms exposed communication\nDDP:       43.4ms × 7.5% = ~3.2ms exposed communication\n```\n\n**Overlap efficiency matters more than raw communication time!**\n:::\n\n### Memory Breakdown (per GPU, 2 GPUs total)\n\n```python\nParameters:  6 GB per GPU (replicated - full copy on each GPU)\nGradients:   6 GB / 2 = 3 GB per GPU (sharded)\nOptimizer:   2 GB / 2 = 1 GB per GPU (sharded)\nActivations: ~1.5 GB per GPU (not sharded)\nPeak Memory: ~8 GB per GPU (1.5x reduction vs. baseline)\n```\n\n### Performance Metrics\n\n```python\nTraining Time: 58.6s (1.92x speedup)\nCommunication Overhead: 87.1 ms (lowest among distributed strategies)\nCompute Efficiency: 97.71% (closest to baseline)\nCommunication Overlap: 98.06% (highest -

waiting for other GPUs at synchronization barriers.

efficiency** — only 0.16% slower than single-GPU baseline. This is exceptional for distributed training!\n\n2. **Communication pattern and overlap matter more than raw communication volume** — FSDP-Grad's 106.8ms of communication time outperforms DDP's 43.4ms because it overlaps 98% of communication with computation, resulting in only 1.7ms of exposed overhead. This is the key insight that drives performance.\n\n3. **All distributed strategies achieve excellent scaling** — 1.9x speedup with 2 GPUs (95% scaling efficiency) demonstrates H100's capabilities.\n\n4. **Memory profiling reveals clean allocation patterns** — No leaks, no fragmentation, 15% utilization leaves room for 5x larger batches.\n\n5. **Per-layer FSDP wrapping is critical** — Enables granular parameter gathering, better overlap through prefetching, and reduced peak memory.\n\n## Strategy Selection Guide\n\n### Choose FSDP-Grad (ZeRO-2) When:\n\n✅ Model fits on a single GPU but you want faster training\n\n✅ You want best performance with memory savings\n\n✅ Training models in 7B-70B parameter range\n\n✅ You have high-bandwidth interconnect (NVLink, InfiniBand)\n\n⭐ **Recommendation**: Default choice for most distributed training scenarios\n\n### Choose FSDP-Full (ZeRO-3) When:\n\n✅ Model absolutely won't fit with FSDP-Grad\n\n✅ You need maximum memory savings (3x+)\n\n✅ Training extremely large models (>100B parameters)\n\n⚠️ You can tolerate ~1% performance loss\n\n### Choose DDP When:\n\n✅ Model comfortably fits in GPU memory\n\n✅ You want simplest implementation\n\n✅ Training smaller models (<7B parameters)\n\n✅ Debugging distributed training issues\n\n### Stay with Single GPU When:\n\n✅ Model fits comfortably with room for larger batches\n\n✅ You don't need faster training\n\n✅ Simplicity is paramount\n\n## Performance Optimization Insights\n\n**Achieved Optimizations:**\n\n1. ✅ Gradient Accumulation with `no_sync()`: Reduces communication by 4x\n2. ✅ Per-Layer FSDP Wrapping: Enables parameter prefetching and better overlap\n3. ✅ NCCL Ring All-Reduce/All-Gather: Efficient collective communication\n4. ✅ NVLink Bandwidth: 900 GB/s enables near-perfect overlap\n\n**Future Optimization Opportunities:**\n\n1. **Activation Checkpointing**: Trade 20-30% compute for 50% memory savings\n2. **Gradient Compression**: Potential 2-4x communication reduction\n3. **Pipeline Parallelism**: For models >100B parameters\n4. **Flash Attention**: Reduce activation memory, increase speed\n\n## Scaling Beyond 2 GPUs\n\n### Expected Scaling Behavior\n\n| GPUs | FSDP_Grad Memory/GPU | DDP Speedup | FSDP Speedup | Communication Overhead |\n|------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| 1 | 12 GB | 1.0x | 1.0x | 0% |\n| 2 | 8 GB | 1.9x | 1.9x | 1.25% |\n| 4 | 6 GB | 3.6x | 3.7x | 2.5% (estimated) |\n| 8 | 4.5 GB | 6.8x | 7.2x | 4.0% (estimated) |\n\n<div align=\"center\"><em>Table 11: Projected Scaling Behavior for GPT-2 Large Beyond 2 GPUs</em></div>\n\n**Scaling Considerations:**\n\n- FSDP_Grad should scale better than DDP (lower per-GPU communication)\n- Communication overhead grows sub-linearly due to NCCL's efficient algorithms\n- NVLink enables near-linear scaling up to 8 GPUs per node\n- Multi-node scaling requires InfiniBand for optimal performance\n\n## Final Recommendations\n\n### For This Experiment (GPT-2 Large, 2x H100)\n\n**Use FSDP_Grad** with the current configuration:\n\n- Global batch size: 32\n- Micro batch size per GPU: 8\n- Gradient accumulation: 2 steps\n- Per-layer wrapping: Enabled\n- Sharding strategy: `SHARD_GRAD_OP`\n\n**Why?**\n\n- 97.71% compute efficiency (essentially matching baseline)\n- 98.06% overlap (only 1.7ms exposed communication)\n- 1.5x memory reduction (room to scale up)\n- Best overall performance-memory trade-off\n\n### Monitoring Metrics\n\nTrack these metrics to ensure optimal performance:\n\n1. **Compute Efficiency**: Should remain >97%\n2. **Communication Overlap**: Should stay >95%\n3. **Idle Time**: Should be <100ms per iteration\n4. **Memory Utilization**: Can increase batch size if needed\n\n### Configuration Checklist\n\n- [x] Use NCCL backend for distributed communication\n- [x] Enable per-layer FSDP wrapping\n- [x] Use `no_sync()` for gradient accumulation\n- [x] Set deterministic seeds across ranks for reproducibility\n- [x] Profile with PyTorch Profiler to verify overlap\n- [x] Monitor memory usage to avoid OOM\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis comprehensive experimental analysis of distributed training strategies demonstrates that **FSDP with gradient sharding (ZeRO-2)** achieves exceptional performance on modern GPU hardware.
