{"markdown":{"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"Ever wondered how researchers train 100B+ parameter models when a single GPU can barely fit 1.5B parameters? 🤔\nOr why your 32GB V100 GPU runs out of memory training a model that only needs 3GB to store its weights?\n\nThe answer lies in understanding where memory actually goes during training—and that's exactly what ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer) solves.\nRecently, I conducted hands-on experiments with ZeRO on Lambda Cloud using 2× A100 GPUs, training a 2.3B parameter model to understand the three progressive optimization stages: ZeRO-1, ZeRO-2, and ZeRO-3.\nThe results were eye-opening:\n\n- ZeRO-1: 29.82% memory reduction with ZERO performance overhead\n- ZeRO-2: 26.53% memory reduction with <5% overhead (at scale)\n- ZeRO-3: 56.34% memory reduction—enabling models that simply wouldn't fit otherwise\nBut the most surprising finding? ZeRO-2 should be your default choice for production training, not ZeRO-1 as many assume.\n\nTL;DR\nI wrote a comprehensive blog breaking down:\n✅ Where memory actually goes during deep learning training (spoiler: it's not just the parameters!)\n✅ How ZeRO works at each stage—from theory to PyTorch implementation\n✅ Real profiler analysis showing exactly what happens during training (memory patterns, communication overhead, compute efficiency)\n✅ Complete reproducible code to run your own experiments\n✅ Decision framework for choosing the right ZeRO stage based on your hardware, model size, and batch constraints\n\nWhether you're training large language models or just curious about distributed training optimization, this guide takes you from fundamentals to implementation with real experimental data.\n\n📖 Read the full blog here: https://lnkd.in/gJ_6FJyG\n\nSpecial thanks to Zachary Mueller for the incredible \"Scratch to Scale\" course that inspired this deep dive into distributed training! 🙏\n\nWhat's your experience with distributed training? Have you used ZeRO or DeepSpeed or FSDP in production? I'd love to hear your insights in the comments!
