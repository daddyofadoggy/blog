chapter covers data preparation and sampling to get input data \"ready\" for the LLM\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/01.webp?timestamp=1\" width=\"500px\">\n\n\n- No code in this section\n\n- There are many forms of embeddings; we focus on text embeddings in this book\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/02.webp\" width=\"500px\">\n\n- LLMs work with embeddings in high-dimensional spaces (i.e., thousands of dimensions)\n- Since we can't visualize such high-dimensional spaces (we humans think in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions), the figure below illustrates a 2-dimensional embedding space\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/03.webp\" width=\"300px\">\n\n## 2.2 Tokenizing text\n\n- In this section, we tokenize text, which means breaking text into smaller units, such as individual words and punctuation characters\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/04.webp\" width=\"300px\">\n\n- Load raw text we want to work with\n- [The Verdict by Edith Wharton](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Verdict) is a public domain short story\n\n- (If you encounter an `ssl.SSLCertVerificationError` when executing the previous code cell, it might be due to using an outdated Python version; you can find [more information here on GitHub](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/pull/403))\n\n- The goal is to tokenize and embed this text for an LLM\n- Let's develop a simple tokenizer based on some simple sample text that we can then later apply to the text above\n- The following regular expression will split on whitespaces\n\n- We don't only want to split on whitespaces but also commas and periods, so let's modify the regular expression to do that as well\n\n- As we can see, this creates empty strings, let's remove them\n\n- This looks pretty good, but let's also handle other types of punctuation, such as periods, question marks, and so on\n\n- This is pretty good, and we are now ready to apply this tokenization to the raw text\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/05.webp\" width=\"350px\">\n\n- Let's calculate the total number of tokens\n\n## 2.3 Converting tokens into token IDs\n\n- Next, we convert the text tokens into token IDs that we can process via embedding layers later\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/06.webp\" width=\"500px\">\n\n- From these tokens, we can now build a vocabulary that consists of all the unique tokens\n\n- Below are the first 50 entries in this vocabulary:\n\n- Below, we illustrate the tokenization of a short sample text using a small vocabulary:\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/07.webp?123\" width=\"500px\">\n\n- Putting it now all together into a tokenizer class\n\n- The `encode` function turns text into token IDs\n- The `decode` function turns token IDs back into text\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/08.webp?123\" width=\"500px\">\n\n- We can use the tokenizer to encode (that is, tokenize) texts into integers\n- These integers can then be embedded (later) as input of/for the LLM\n\n- We can decode the integers back into text\n\n## 2.4 Adding special context tokens\n\n- It's useful to add some \"special\" tokens for unknown words and to denote the end of a text\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/09.webp?123\" width=\"500px\">\n\n- Some tokenizers use special tokens to help the LLM with additional context\n- Some of these special tokens are\n  - `[BOS]` (beginning of sequence) marks the beginning of text\n  - `[EOS]` (end of sequence) marks where the text ends (this is usually used to concatenate multiple unrelated texts, e.g., two different Wikipedia articles or two different books, and so on)\n  - `[PAD]` (padding) if we train LLMs with a batch size greater than 1 (we may include multiple texts with different lengths; with the padding token we pad the shorter texts to the longest length so that all texts have an equal length)\n- `[UNK]` to represent words that are not included in the vocabulary\n\n- Note that GPT-2 does not need any of these tokens mentioned above but only uses an `<|endoftext|>` token to reduce complexity\n- The `<|endoftext|>` is analogous to the `[EOS]` token mentioned above\n- GPT also uses the `<|endoftext|>` for padding (since we typically use a mask when training on batched inputs, we would not attend padded tokens anyways, so it does not matter what these tokens are)\n- GPT-2 does not use an `<UNK>` token for out-of-vocabulary words; instead, GPT-2 uses a byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer, which breaks down words into subword units which we will discuss in a later section\n\n\n\n- We use the `<|endoftext|>` tokens between two independent sources of text:\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/10.webp\" width=\"500px\">\n\n- Let's see what happens if we tokenize the following text:\n\n- The above produces an error because the word \"Hello\" is not contained in the vocabulary\n- To deal with such cases, we can add special tokens like `\"<|unk|>\"` to the vocabulary to represent unknown words\n- Since we are already extending the vocabulary, let's add another token called `\"<|endoftext|>\"` which is used in GPT-2 training to denote the end of a text (and it's also used between concatenated text, like if our training datasets consists of multiple articles, books, etc.)\n\n- We also need to adjust the tokenizer accordingly so that it knows when and how to use the new `<unk>` token\n\nLet's try to tokenize text with the modified tokenizer:\n\n## 2.5 BytePair encoding\n\n- GPT-2 used BytePair encoding (BPE) as its tokenizer\n- it allows the model to break down words that aren't in its predefined vocabulary into smaller subword units or even individual characters, enabling it to handle out-of-vocabulary words\n- For instance, if GPT-2's vocabulary doesn't have the word \"unfamiliarword,\" it might tokenize it as [\"unfam\", \"iliar\", \"word\"] or some other subword breakdown, depending on its trained BPE merges\n- The original BPE tokenizer can be found here: [https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/src/encoder.py](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/src/encoder.py)\n- In this chapter, we are using the BPE tokenizer from OpenAI's open-source [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) library, which implements its core algorithms in Rust to improve computational performance\n- I created a notebook in the [./bytepair_encoder](../02_bonus_bytepair-encoder) that compares these two implementations side-by-side (tiktoken was about 5x faster on the sample text)\n\n- BPE tokenizers break down unknown words into subwords and individual characters:\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/11.webp\" width=\"300px\">\n\n## 2.6 Data sampling with a sliding window\n\n- We train LLMs to generate one word at a time, so we want to prepare the training data accordingly where the next word in a sequence represents the target to predict:\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/12.webp\" width=\"400px\">\n\n- For each text chunk, we want the inputs and targets\n- Since we want the model to predict the next word, the targets are the inputs shifted by one position to the right\n\n- One by one, the prediction would look like as follows:\n\n- We will take care of the next-word prediction in a later chapter after we covered the attention mechanism\n- For now, we implement a simple data loader that iterates over the input dataset and returns the inputs and targets shifted by one\n\n- Install and import PyTorch (see Appendix A for installation tips)\n\n- We use a sliding window approach, changing the position by +1:\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/13.webp?123\" width=\"500px\">\n\n- Create dataset and dataloader that extract chunks from the input text dataset\n\n- Let's test the dataloader with a batch size of 1 for an LLM with a context size of 4:\n\n- An example using stride equal to the context length (here: 4) as shown below:\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/14.webp\" width=\"500px\">\n\n- We can also create batched outputs\n- Note that we increase the stride here so that we don't have overlaps between the batches, since more overlap could lead to increased overfitting\n\n## 2.7 Creating token embeddings\n\n- The data is already almost ready for an LLM\n- But lastly let us embed the tokens in a continuous vector representation using an embedding layer\n- Usually, these embedding layers are part of the LLM itself and are updated (trained) during model training\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/15.webp\" width=\"400px\">\n\n- Suppose we have the following four input examples with input ids 2, 3, 5, and 1 (after tokenization):\n\n- For the sake of simplicity, suppose we have a small vocabulary of only 6 words and we want to create embeddings of size 3:\n\n- This would result in a 6x3 weight matrix:\n\n- For those who are familiar with one-hot encoding, the embedding layer approach above is essentially just a more efficient way of implementing one-hot encoding followed by matrix multiplication in a fully-connected layer, which is described in the supplementary code in [./embedding_vs_matmul](../03_bonus_embedding-vs-matmul)\n- Because the embedding layer is just a more efficient implementation that is equivalent to the one-hot encoding and matrix-multiplication approach it can be seen as a neural network layer that can be optimized via backpropagation\n\n- To convert a token with id 3 into a 3-dimensional vector, we do the following:\n\n- Note that the above is the 4th row in the `embedding_layer` weight matrix\n- To embed all four `input_ids` values above, we do\n\n- An embedding layer is essentially a look-up operation:\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/16.webp?123\" width=\"500px\">\n\n- **You may be interested in the bonus content comparing embedding layers with regular linear layers: [../03_bonus_embedding-vs-matmul](../03_bonus_embedding-vs-matmul)**\n\n## 2.8 Encoding word positions\n\n- Embedding layer convert IDs into identical vector representations regardless of where they are located in the input sequence:\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/17.webp\" width=\"400px\">\n\n- Positional embeddings are combined with the token embedding vector to form the input embeddings for a large language model:\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/18.webp\" width=\"500px\">\n\n- The BytePair encoder has a vocabulary size of 50,257:\n- Suppose we want to encode the input tokens into a 256-dimensional vector representation:\n\n- If we sample data from the dataloader, we embed the tokens in each batch into a 256-dimensional vector\n- If we have a batch size of 8 with 4 tokens each, this results in a 8 x 4 x 256 tensor:\n\n- GPT-2 uses absolute position embeddings, so we just create another embedding layer:\n\n- To create the input embeddings used in an LLM, we simply add the token and the positional embeddings:\n\n- In the initial phase of the input processing workflow, the input text is segmented into separate tokens\n- Following this segmentation, these tokens are transformed into token IDs based on a predefined vocabulary:\n\n<img
