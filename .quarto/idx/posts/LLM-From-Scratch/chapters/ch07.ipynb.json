the figure below illustrates two example formats that were used for training the Alpaca (https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) and Phi-3 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219) LLMs, respectively\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/prompt-style.webp?1\" width=500px>\n\n- In this chapter, we use Alpaca-style prompt formatting, which was the original prompt template for instruction finetuning\n- Below, we format the input that we will pass as input to the LLM\n\n- A formatted response with input field looks like as shown below\n\n- Below is a formatted response without an input field\n\n- Lastly, before we prepare the PyTorch data loaders in the next section, we divide the dataset into a training, validation, and test set\n\n## 7.3 Organizing data into training batches\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/chapter-overview-2.webp?1\" width=500px>\n\n- We tackle this dataset batching in several steps, as summarized in the figure below\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/detailed-batching.webp?1\" width=500px>\n\n- First, we implement an `InstructionDataset` class that pre-tokenizes all inputs in the dataset, similar to the `SpamDataset` in chapter 6\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/pretokenizing.webp\" width=500px>\n\n- Similar to chapter 6, we want to collect multiple training examples in a batch to accelerate training; this requires padding all inputs to a similar length\n- Also similar to the previous chapter, we use the `<|endoftext|>` token as a padding token\n\n- In chapter 6, we padded all examples in a dataset to the same length\n  - Here, we take a more sophisticated approach and develop a custom \"collate\" function that we can pass to the data loader\n  - This custom collate function pads the training examples in each batch to have the same length (but different batches can have different lengths)\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/padding.webp\" width=500px>\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/batching-step-4.webp?1\" width=500px>\n\n- Above, we only returned the inputs to the LLM; however, for LLM training, we also need the target values\n- Similar to pretraining an LLM, the targets are the inputs shifted by 1 position to the right, so the LLM learns to predict the next token\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/inputs-targets.webp?1\" width=400px>\n\n- Next, we introduce an `ignore_index` value to replace all padding token IDs with a new value; the purpose of this `ignore_index` is that we can ignore padding values in the loss function (more on that later)\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/batching-step-5.webp?1\" width=500px>\n\n- Concretely, this means that we replace the token IDs corresponding to `50256` with `-100` as illustrated below\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/ignore-index.webp?1\" width=500px>\n\n- (In addition, we also introduce the `allowed_max_length` in case we want to limit the length of the samples; this will be useful if you plan to work with your own datasets that are longer than the 1024 token context size supported by the GPT-2 model)\n\n- Let's see what this replacement by -100 accomplishes\n- For illustration purposes, let's assume we have a small classification task with 2 class labels, 0 and 1, similar to chapter 6\n- If we have the following logits values (outputs of the last layer of the model), we calculate the following loss\n\n- Now, adding one more training example will, as expected, influence the loss\n\n- Let's see what happens if we replace the class label of one of the examples with -100\n\n- As we can see, the resulting loss on these 3 training examples is the same as the loss we calculated from the 2 training examples, which means that the cross-entropy loss function ignored the training example with the -100 label\n- By default, PyTorch has the `cross_entropy(..., ignore_index=-100)` setting to ignore examples corresponding to the label -100\n- Using this -100 `ignore_index`, we can ignore the additional end-of-text (padding) tokens in the batches that we used to pad the training examples to equal length\n- However, we don't want to ignore the first instance of the end-of-text (padding) token (50256) because it can help signal to the LLM when the response is complete\n\n- In practice, it is also common to mask out the target token IDs that correspond to the instruction, as illustrated in the figure below (this is a recommended reader exercise after completing the chapter)\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/mask-instructions.webp?1\" width=600px>\n\n## 7.4 Creating data loaders for an instruction dataset\n\n- In this section, we use the `InstructionDataset` class and `custom_collate_fn` function to instantiate the training, validation, and test data loaders\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/chapter-overview-3.webp?1\" width=500px>\n\n- Another additional detail of the previous `custom_collate_fn` function is that we now directly move the data to the target device (e.g., GPU) instead of doing it in the main training loop, which improves efficiency because it can be carried out as a background process when we use the `custom_collate_fn` as part of the data loader\n- Using the `partial` function from Python's `functools` standard library, we create a new function with the `device` argument of the original function pre-filled\n\n- Next, we instantiate the data loaders similar to previous chapters, except that we now provide our own collate function for the batching process\n\n- Let's see what the dimensions of the resulting input and target batches look like\n\n- As we can see based on the output above, all batches have a batch size of 8 but a different length, as expected\n- Let's also double-check that the inputs contain the `<|endoftext|>` padding tokens corresponding to token ID 50256 by printing the contents of the first training example in the `inputs` batch\n\n- Similarly, we visually double-check that the targets contain the -100 placeholder tokens\n\n## 7.5 Loading a pretrained LLM\n\n- In this section, we load a pretrained GPT model using the same code that we used in section 5.5 of chapter 5 and section 6.4 in chapter 6\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/chapter-overview-4.webp?1\" width=500px>\n\n- However, instead of loading the smallest 124 million parameter model, we load the medium version with 355 million parameters since the 124 million model is too small for achieving qualitatively reasonable results via instruction finetuning\n\n- Before we start finetuning the model in the next section, let's see how it performs on one of the validation tasks\n\n- Note that the `generate` function we used in previous chapters returns the combined input and output text, which was convenient in the previous section for creating legible text\n- To isolate the response, we can subtract the length of the instruction from the start of the `generated_text`\n\n- As we can see, the model is not capable of following the instructions, yet; it creates a \"Response\" section but it simply repeats the original input sentence as well as the instruction\n\n## 7.6 Finetuning the LLM on instruction data\n\n- In this section, we finetune the model\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/chapter-overview-5.webp?1\" width=500px>\n\n- Note that we can reuse all the loss calculation and training functions that we used in previous chapters\n\n- Let's calculate the initial training and validation set loss before we start training (as in previous chapters, the goal is to minimize the loss)\n\n- Note that the training is a bit more expensive than in previous chapters since we are using a larger model (355 million instead of 124 million parameters)\n- The runtimes for various devices are shown for reference below (running this notebook on a compatible GPU device requires no changes to the code)\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n    \n| Model              | Device                | Runtime for 2 Epochs |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| gpt2-medium (355M) | CPU (M3 MacBook Air)  | 15.78 minutes        |\n| gpt2-medium (355M) | GPU (M3 MacBook Air)  | 10.77 minutes        |\n| gpt2-medium (355M) | GPU (L4)              | 1.83 minutes         |\n| gpt2-medium (355M) | GPU (A100)            | 0.86 minutes         |\n| gpt2-small (124M)  | CPU (M3 MacBook Air)  | 5.74 minutes         |\n| gpt2-small (124M)  | GPU (M3 MacBook Air)  | 3.73 minutes         |\n| gpt2-small (124M)  | GPU (L4)              | 0.69 minutes         |\n| gpt2-small (124M)  | GPU (A100)            | 0.39 minutes         |\n\n</div>\n\n- I ran this notebook using the `\"gpt2-medium (355M)\"` model\n\n- As we can see based on the outputs above, the model trains well, as we can tell based on the decreasing training loss and validation loss values\n- Furthermore, based on the response text printed after each epoch, we can see that the model correctly follows the instruction to convert the input sentence `'The chef cooks the meal every day.'` into passive voice `'The meal is cooked every day by the chef.'` (We will properly format and evaluate the responses in a later section)\n- Finally, let's take a look at the training and validation loss curves\n\n- As we can see, the loss decreases sharply at the beginning of the first epoch, which means the model starts learning quickly\n- We can see that slight overfitting sets in at around 1 training epoch\n\n## 7.7 Extracting and saving responses\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/chapter-overview-6.webp?1\" width=500px>\n\n- In this section, we save the test set responses for scoring in the next section\n- We also save a copy of the model for future use\n- But first, let's take a brief look at the responses generated by the finetuned model\n\n- As we can see based on the test set instructions, given responses, and the model's responses, the model performs relatively well\n- The answers to the first and last instructions are clearly correct\n- The second answer is close; the model answers with \"cumulus cloud\" instead of \"cumulonimbus\" (however, note that cumulus clouds can develop into cumulonimbus clouds, which are capable of producing thunderstorms)\n- Most importantly, we can see that model evaluation is not as straightforward as in the previous chapter, where we just had to calculate the percentage of correct spam/non-spam class labels to obtain the classification accuracy\n- In practice, instruction-finetuned LLMs such as chatbots are evaluated via multiple approaches\n  - short-answer and multiple choice benchmarks such as MMLU (\"Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding\", [https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300)), which test the knowledge of a model\n  - human preference comparison to other LLMs, such as LMSYS chatbot arena ([https://arena.lmsys.org](https://arena.lmsys.org))\n  - automated conversational benchmarks, where another LLM like GPT-4 is used to evaluate the responses, such as AlpacaEval ([https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/))\n\n- In the next section, we will use an approach similar to AlpacaEval and use another LLM to evaluate the responses of our model; however, we will use our own test set instead of using a publicly available benchmark dataset\n- For this, we add the model response to the `test_data` dictionary and save it as a `\"instruction-data-with-response.json\"` file for record-keeping so that we can load and analyze it in separate Python sessions if needed\n\n- Let's double-check one of the entries to see whether the responses have been added to the `test_data` dictionary correctly\n\n- Finally, we also save the model in case we want to reuse it in the future\n\n## 7.8 Evaluating the finetuned LLM\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/chapter-overview-7.webp?1\" width=500px>\n\n- In this section, we automate the response evaluation of the finetuned LLM using another, larger LLM\n- In particular, we use an instruction-finetuned 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 model by Meta AI that can be run locally via ollama ([https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com))\n- (Alternatively, if you prefer using a more capable LLM like GPT-4 via the OpenAI API, please see the [llm-instruction-eval-openai.ipynb](../03_model-evaluation/llm-instruction-eval-openai.ipynb) notebook)\n\n- Ollama is an application to run LLMs efficiently\n- It is a wrapper around llama.cpp ([https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)), which implements LLMs in pure C/C++ to maximize efficiency\n- Note that it is a tool for using LLMs to generate text (inference), not training or finetuning LLMs\n- Before running the code below, install ollama by visiting [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and following the instructions (for instance, clicking on the \"Download\" button and downloading the ollama application for your operating system)\n\n- For macOS and Windows users, click on the ollama application you downloaded; if it prompts you to install the command line usage, say \"yes\"\n- Linux users can use the installation command provided on the ollama website\n\n- In general, before we can use ollama from the command line, we have to either start the ollama application or run `ollama serve` in a separate terminal\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/ollama-run.webp?1\" width=700px>\n\n\n- With the ollama application or `ollama serve` running in a different terminal, on the command line, execute the following command to try out the 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 model (the model, which takes up 4.7 GB of storage space, will be automatically downloaded the first time you execute this command)\n\n```bash\n# 8B model\nollama run llama3\n```\n\n\nThe output looks like as follows\n\n```\n$ ollama run llama3\npulling manifest\npulling 6a0746a1ec1a... 100% ▕████████████████▏ 4.7 GB\npulling 4fa551d4f938... 100% ▕████████████████▏  12 KB\npulling 8ab4849b038c... 100% ▕████████████████▏  254 B\npulling 577073ffcc6c... 100% ▕████████████████▏  110 B\npulling 3f8eb4da87fa... 100% ▕████████████████▏  485 B\nverifying sha256 digest\nwriting manifest\nremoving any unused layers\nsuccess\n```\n\n- Note that `llama3` refers to the instruction finetuned 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 model\n\n- Using ollama with the `\"llama3\"` model (a 8B parameter model) requires 16 GB of RAM; if this is not supported by your machine, you can try the smaller model, such as the 3.8B parameter phi-3 model by setting `model = \"phi-3\"`, which only requires 8 GB of RAM\n\n- Alternatively, you can also use the larger 70-billion-parameter Llama 3 model, if your machine supports it, by replacing `llama3` with `llama3:70b`\n\n- After the download has been completed, you will see a command line prompt that allows you to chat with the model\n\n- Try a prompt like \"What do llamas eat?\", which should return an output similar to the following\n\n```\n>>> What do llamas eat?\nLlamas are ruminant animals, which means they have a four-chambered\nstomach and eat plants that are high in fiber. In the wild, llamas\ntypically feed on:\n1. Grasses: They love to graze on various types of grasses, including tall\ngrasses, wheat, oats, and barley.\n```\n\n- You can end this session using the input `/bye`\n\n- The following code checks whether the ollama session is running correctly before proceeding to use ollama to evaluate the test set responses we generated in the previous section\n\n- Now, an alternative way to the `ollama run` command we used earlier to interact with the model is via its REST API in Python via the following function\n- Before you run the next cells in this notebook, make sure that ollama is still running (the previous code cells should print `\"Ollama running: True\"`)\n- Next, run the following code cell to query the model\n\n- Now, using the `query_model` function we defined above, we can evaluate the responses of our finetuned model; let's try it out on the first 3 test set responses we looked at in a previous section\n\n---\n\n**Note: Better evaluation prompt**\n\n- [A reader (Ayoosh Kathuria) suggested](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/discussions/449) a longer, improved prompt that evaluates responses on a scale of 1–5 (instead of 1 to 100) and employs a grading rubric, resulting in more accurate and less noisy evaluations:\n\n```\nprompt = \"\"\"\nYou are a fair judge assistant tasked with providing clear, objective feedback based on specific criteria, ensuring each assessment reflects the absolute standards set for performance.\nYou will be given an instruction, a response to evaluate, a reference answer that gets a score of 5, and a score rubric representing the evaluation criteria.\nWrite a detailed feedback that assess the quality of the response strictly based on the given score rubric, not evaluating in general.\nPlease do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.\n\nHere is the rubric you should use to build your answer:\n1: The response fails to address the instructions, providing irrelevant, incorrect, or excessively verbose information that detracts from the user's request.\n2: The response partially addresses the instructions but includes significant inaccuracies, irrelevant details, or excessive elaboration that detracts from the main task.\n3: The response follows the instructions with some minor inaccuracies or omissions. It is generally relevant and clear, but may include some unnecessary details or could be more concise.\n4: The response adheres to the instructions, offering clear, accurate, and relevant information in a concise manner, with only occasional, minor instances of excessive detail or slight lack of clarity.\n5: The response fully adheres to the instructions, providing a clear, accurate, and relevant answer in a concise and efficient manner. It addresses all aspects of the request without unnecessary details or elaboration\n\nProvide your feedback as follows:\n\nFeedback:::\nEvaluation: (your rationale for the rating, as a text)\nTotal rating: (your rating, as a number between 1 and 5)\n\nYou MUST provide values for 'Evaluation:' and 'Total rating:' in your answer.\n\nNow here is the instruction, the reference answer, and the response.\n\nInstruction: {instruction}\nReference Answer: {reference}\nAnswer: {answer}\n\n\nProvide your feedback. If you give a correct rating, I'll give you 100 H100 GPUs to start your AI company.\nFeedback:::\nEvaluation: \"\"\"\n```\n\n- For more context and information, see [this](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/discussions/449) GitHub discussion\n\n---\n\n- As we can see, the Llama 3 model provides a reasonable evaluation and also gives partial points if a model is not entirely correct, as we can see based on the \"cumulus cloud\" answer\n- Note that the previous prompt returns very verbose evaluations; we can tweak the prompt to generate integer responses in the range between 0 and 100 (where 100 is best) to calculate an average score for our model\n- The evaluation of the 110 entries in the test set takes about 1 minute on an M3 MacBook Air laptop\n\n- Our model achieves an average score of above 50, which we can use as a reference point to compare the model to other models or to try out other training settings that may improve the model\n- Note that ollama is not fully deterministic across operating systems (as of this writing), so the numbers you are getting might slightly differ from the ones shown above\n\n- For reference, the original\n  - Llama 3 8B base model achieves a score of 58.51\n  - Llama 3 8B instruct model achieves a score of 82.65\n\n## 7.9 Conclusions\n\n### 7.9.1 What's next\n\n- This marks the final chapter of this book\n- We covered the major steps of the LLM development cycle: implementing an LLM architecture, pretraining an LLM, and finetuning it\n\n<img src=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch07_compressed/final-overview.webp?1\" width=500px>\n\n- An optional step that is sometimes followed after instruction finetuning, as described in this chapter, is preference finetuning\n- Preference finetuning process can be particularly useful for customizing a model to better align with specific user preferences; see the [../04_preference-tuning-with-dpo](../04_preference-tuning-with-dpo) folder if you are interested in this\n\n- This GitHub repository also contains a large selection of additional bonus material you may enjoy; for more information, please see the [Bonus Material](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch?tab=readme-ov-file#bonus-material) section on this repository's README page\n\n### 7.9.2 Staying up to date in a fast-moving field\n\n- No code in this section\n\n### 7.9.3 Final words\n\n- I hope you enjoyed this journey of implementing an LLM from the ground up and coding the pretraining and finetuning functions\n- In my opinion, implementing an LLM from scratch is the best way to understand how LLMs work; I hope you gained a better understanding through this approach\n- While this book serves educational purposes, you may be interested in using different and more powerful LLMs for real-world applications\n  - For this, you may consider popular tools such as axolotl ([https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl)) or LitGPT ([https://github.com/Lightning-AI/litgpt](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/litgpt)), which I help developing\n\n## Summary and takeaways\n\n- See the [./gpt_instruction_finetuning.py](./gpt_instruction_finetuning.py) script, a self-contained script for instruction finetuning\n- [./ollama_evaluate.py](./ollama_evaluate.py) is a standalone script based on section 7.8 that evaluates a JSON file containing \"output\" and \"response\" keys via Ollama and Llama 3\n- The [./load-finetuned-model.ipynb](./load-finetuned-model.ipynb) notebook illustrates how to load the finetuned model in a new session\n- You can find the exercise solutions in [./exercise-solutions.ipynb](./exercise-solutions.ipynb)\n\n## What's next?\n\n- Congrats on completing the book; in case you are looking for additional resources, I added several bonus sections to this GitHub repository that you might find interesting\n- The complete list of bonus materials can be viewed in the main README's [Bonus Material](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch?tab=readme-ov-file#bonus-material) section\n- To highlight a few of my favorites:\n  1.
